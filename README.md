The flight price prediction project has the potential to benefit both travelers and businesses in various ways, from saving money and time to gaining a competitive advantage.

In this project various machine learning models have been used to predict the price for the flight ticket.

And the machine learning models are :

        1.Linear Regressor
        2.Decision Tree Regressor
        3.Random Forest Regressor etc.
        
Under this project first the dataset is loaded and the preprocessing techniques have been done like removing null values, removing duplicates etc.

And the categorical features and numerical features have been found.

After the feature selection process the data has splitted into train and test data.

By using these train and test data various ML models have been used to predict the price of the ticket.
